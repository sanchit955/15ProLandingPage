## üö¶ Running the project:
1. First, you need to clone the project from the GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lawani-EJ/15ProLandingPage
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd AppleIphonePro
   ```
3. Install the project dependencies using `npm`:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the Vite development server, and the project will be available at a local address (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).

5. Open your browser and visit the URL displayed in the terminal to view the application.

6. To build the project for production, use:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This will generate optimized static assets in the `dist` folder.

7. To preview the production build locally, use:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```
   This is useful to test how the application works in a production-like environment.
